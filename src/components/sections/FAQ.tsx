      question: "How does customization work?",
      answer: "With Boothie Bling, you can add whatever makes your experience extra: prints, premium props, custom templates, filters, guestbook, audio messagesâ€”you name it. Build a setup that fits your event, your vibe, and your budget."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I add features to Boothie Lite?",
      answer: "Yes! Boothie Bling lets you upgrade your Boothie Lite experience however you like. Add boomerangs, GIFs, text delivery, filters, extra props, premium backdrops, prints, concierge serviceâ€”even a red carpet moment."
    },
    {
      question: "Whatâ€™s in The Whole Boothie?",
      answer: "The Whole Boothie is our all-inclusive experience. It comes fully loaded with multiple photo/video modes, prints (up to 500), fun filters, all props, premium backdrop, concierge, custom templates, red carpet, and roaming."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade to The Whole Boothie after booking Boothie Lite?",
      answer: "Absolutely. If you start with Boothie Lite and change your mind, we can apply your payment toward The Whole Boothie and upgrade your experience."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a concierge?",
      answer: "If you're looking for a red carpet feel or want an extra set of hands to assist guests, the concierge add-on is ðŸ’¯ worth it. Already included in The Whole Boothie or available Ã  la carte with Boothie Bling."
    },
    {
      question: "Whatâ€™s the red carpet experience?",
      answer: "Our Red Carpet Special includes stanchions, the carpet itself, and a Boothie Concierge to guide your guests. It's a total glam momentâ€”available as a Boothie Bling upgrade or part of The Whole Boothie."
    },
    {
      question: "Whatâ€™s Roaming?",
      answer: "Sometimes the best moments happen away from the backdrop. For 15 minutes, your Boothie Attendant will roam the event, snapping photos and boomerangs on the goâ€”from the dance floor to the bar."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I mix and match Boothie Bling?",
      answer: "Yes! Thatâ€™s the beauty of Boothie Bling. Pick exactly what you need and skip what you donâ€™t. Want filters but not prints? Props but no concierge? Done and done."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you travel outside of LA?",
      answer: "We sure do! Travel within 25 miles of Los Angeles is included. Beyond that, a small travel fee may applyâ€”just ask and weâ€™ll work it out."
    },
    {
      question: "Whatâ€™s your cancellation policy?",
      answer: "Life happens; we get it. Retainers are non-refundable, but weâ€™re happy to reschedule your date if needed (subject to availability). Just give us a heads-up at least 14 days in advance."
